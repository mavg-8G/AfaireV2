## Core Features:

- Personalized Theme Generation: Utilize a generative AI tool to personalize app layout and color scheme suggestions based on user preferences and common usage patterns, providing options for various themes (e.g., minimalist, modern, vibrant) to enhance user experience. The AI tool will decide whether to apply those changes
- Theme Customizer: Implement a user-friendly theme customizer that allows users to adjust colors, fonts, and layout elements in real-time. Offer a preview feature to visualize changes before applying them.
- Theme Sharing: Develop a simple sharing feature enabling users to share their customized app themes with friends or the broader community, promoting user engagement and a sense of belonging.
- Theme Persistence: Incorporate local storage to save user theme preferences, ensuring a consistent look and feel across multiple sessions without requiring users to log in.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid Purple (#9F50E3) to evoke creativity and individuality.
- Background color: Light Lavender (#EEE7F7) to maintain a soft, unobtrusive base.
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#50E3D6) for highlighting interactive elements and CTAs, creating visual contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern, versatile appearance.
- Use flat, minimalist icons to match the clean aesthetic of the app. Icons should be easily recognizable and contextually relevant to their actions.
- Design a flexible grid layout to adapt to various screen sizes. Prioritize content clarity and user navigation by using a single-column design on mobile and multi-column on larger screens.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations for theme changes and sharing actions, providing visual feedback to enhance user engagement and the feeling of app responsiveness.
